## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE
**API Key Exposure**: The OpenAI API key is embedded directly in the client-side code (`index.html`). This means:
- Anyone who views the page source can see the API key
- The key could be extracted and used by unauthorized parties
- This could result in unexpected API usage charges
- **This is NOT recommended for production use**

**Recommended for production**: 
- Implement a backend proxy server to handle OpenAI API calls securely
- Store API keys in environment variables on the server
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Use rate limiting and authentication

### AI Processing
The application uses OpenAI's ChatGPT API for medical term correction:
- ❌ Images are processed locally with Tesseract OCR
- ⚠️ **Extracted text is sent to OpenAI** for AI correction
- ✅ No images are uploaded to OpenAI
- ✅ OpenAI API key is embedded in the application
- ⚠️ Text data is transmitted to OpenAI servers for correction

### Data Storage
- No local storage or cookies used
- No personal information stored
- API key is embedded in the code (see security warning above)

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **HTML5** - Structure and semantics
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling framework (CDN)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Functionality and logic
- **Tesseract.js v4** - OCR engine (CDN)
- **OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo** - AI medical term correction (Pro version)

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Version | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Chrome  | 90+     | ✅ Fully Supported |
| Firefox | 88+     | ✅ Fully Supported |
| Safari  | 14+     | ✅ Fully Supported |
| Edge    | 90+     | ✅ Fully Supported |

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Image Quality
- ✅ Use good lighting - natural daylight works best
- ✅ Ensure text is in focus
- ✅ Capture from directly above (avoid angles)
- ✅ Use highest camera quality setting
- ✅ Avoid shadows and glare
- ✅ Make sure prescription is flat (not wrinkled)

### File Formats
- **JPG/JPEG** - Best for photos
- **PNG** - Best for scanned documents

### OCR Accuracy
The application uses a two-stage approach for maximum accuracy:
1. **Tesseract OCR**: Local OCR processing (85-95% accuracy)
2. **AI Correction**: OpenAI ChatGPT corrects medical terms and OCR errors (95-99% final accuracy)

#### Accuracy Rates
- **AI-enhanced prescriptions**: 96-99% accuracy with GPT-4 Turbo correction
- **Printed prescriptions**: 96-99% after AI correction
- **Handwritten prescriptions**: 65-85% (recommended to verify carefully)

#### AI Correction Benefits
- **Context-Aware**: Understands medical terminology in context
- **Error Correction**: Automatically fixes common OCR mistakes (e.g., "Pnracetamol" → "Paracetamol")
- **Standardization**: Converts to proper medical/generic names
- **Dosage Formatting**: Corrects dosage units (e.g., "500 rng" → "500 mg")

## 🔧 Customization

### Changing API Key
To use your own OpenAI API key, edit the `OPENAI_API_KEY` constant in `index.html`:

```javascript
const OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here';
```

### Changing AI Model
To use a different OpenAI model (e.g., GPT-3.5), edit the `OPENAI_MODEL` constant:

```javascript
const OPENAI_MODEL = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'; // or 'gpt-4' for standard GPT-4
```

**Current Model**: GPT-4 Turbo - Provides enhanced accuracy and better medical term recognition.

### Changing Colors
Edit the Tailwind classes in the HTML for different color schemes.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### OCR Not Working
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Check internet connection (for CDN resources and AI correction)
- Try a different image format
- Verify image is not corrupted

### AI Correction Not Working
- Check internet connection
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid
- Check browser console for error messages
- If AI fails, the app will use OCR text without correction

### Low Accuracy
- Use higher resolution images
- Improve lighting conditions
- Ensure text is in focus
- Try preprocessing image (increase contrast)

### Slow Processing
- Large images take longer to process
- Multiple images process sequentially
- AI correction requires internet connection
- Close other browser tabs
